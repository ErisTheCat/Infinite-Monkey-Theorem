# Infinite-Monkey-Theorem
## What is this?

This is a very old project of mine that's based on the [Infinite monkey theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) which states that a monkey hitting random keys on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time will eventually type any given text.

This script randomly generates strings of letters until it matches a word you provide.

## How do i run it?

1. Make sure you installed the requirements by doing
   <pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>
2. Execute the script in a terminal
   <pre>python infinitemonkey.py</pre>
3. Write the word you want the script to attempt to find
4. Either write yes or no when prompted if you want to save the words found in a text file
5. Done
